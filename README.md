Project Motivation:
I created this web scraper because I was genuinely curious about how data from websites can be collected and used effectively. After a conversation during a coffee chat I had about web scraping sparked my interest, I wanted to dive in and try it myself. Building this small projectâ€”extracting author names and blog titles was a hands-on way to transform that curiosity into real skills. It was exciting to see code come to life and produce tangible results, and it motivated me to keep exploring the many ways that web scraping can uncover valuable information on the internet.
